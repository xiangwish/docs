We support a variety of payment channels and payment methods. If your device has a payment method inconsistency, you can contact our customer service staff. At the same time, some payment methods require hardware support, and if your device is an old model, it may not be able to be updated. You can purchase our updated equipment.

The configuration of the payment method is modified by yourself, we will not take the initiative to help customers with configuration.

If you find that some payment methods are not available in your region, you can let us know and we will consider using payment hardware and payment channels that are available in your local area.

If you want to configure the updated payment method, you can contact us and we will try to provide corresponding help.
