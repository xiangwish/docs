## Revenue Sharing Feature Description

We currently support revenue sharing settings for up to three levels, providing users with a flexible solution for payment and revenue distribution. Below are the detailed explanations of the feature:

### 1. What is Revenue Sharing?

Currently, our revenue sharing feature supports the following two payment platforms:

| Type       | Support |

| WeChat Pay | YES     |
| Alipay     | YES     |

You can choose either of these platforms to configure revenue sharing, meeting the needs of various payment scenarios.

### 3. Revenue Sharing Cycles

In addition to configuring revenue sharing amounts and accounts, we also support flexible sharing cycle settings. Based on your business requirements, you can select the following cycle types:

Instant Sharing: Revenue is distributed immediately after the transaction is completed.
Scheduled Sharing: Revenue is distributed according to a predefined cycle (e.g., daily, weekly).
